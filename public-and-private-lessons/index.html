                    <p><em>Omote </em>and <em>Ura</em> are a pair of words generally translated as <em>front</em> and <em>back</em>, i.e. they depend on physical location and relationships to one another. </p><p>They are used to describe the nage's movement in relation to the uke – <em>omote</em> passing across the front of the uke, <em>ura</em> passing behind. On some occasions, I have heard them used in place of <em>irimi</em> (entering) and <em>tenkan (turning)</em> though I think there are specific differences  between the pairs that make this less useful.</p><p>So that is the generally understood Aikido usage – to refer to positioning.</p><p>However, there is another reading of front/back which gives rise to public/private, open/secret, visible/invisible – that allows us to find <em>omote</em> and <em>ura</em> anywhere we care to look on the mat. </p><p>For example, I had the opportunity to attend a course taught by a senior teacher recently. He was teaching a range of grades, and leading the students through the various points he wished to highlight.</p><p>I was his uke for the duration and, as a result, experienced at first hand what he was talking about. More importantly, I experienced what he was not talking about, what was not highlighted for the class. That which was said was inevitably a reduced selection of that which was available to me. There were, in effect, two lessons taking place – the <em>omote</em> lesson of the teacher instructing, and the <em>ura</em> lesson of his nervous system communicating directly to mine. Public and private, open and hidden, spoken and embodied.</p><p>This is only worth mentioning – after all, given a moment to consider, we know that speech can be but a subsection of the greater experience – because it should encourage us to lean further into the hidden depths of ukemi. That is where the learning really is.</p><p>I came across a harsh story (perhaps via Ellis Amdur) of horses that highlights what I'm getting at. The horse that is already responsive learns nothing from its owner; the horse that needs leading learns more, more deeply; but the nag that needs whipping to do anything is the greatest treasure because that horse learns down to its very bones how to behave. I'm not one for whipping animals, so this makes an unpleasant story, but ... for our purposes, if we want our study of aikido to penetrate down to our very bones, then we should seek to learn via every mode possible. Not just <em>omote</em> verbal instructions, but those <em>ura </em>instructions that simply can't be verbalised.</p><p>I'm not talking about verbal instructions that teachers choose to withhold, but those instructions that are secret even to them – the lessons that their bodies make available.</p><p>If we only look for what is visible, we will never see the invisible. If we only listen for what is said, we'll never hear what is left unsaid.</p><p>When I teach, I spend little time on ukemi beyond ensuring that ukes know how to move in order to stay safe. I often think I should talk more about it, tell them how to follow, what to look for, what mindset to have. But after this recent course, I think that ukemi (beyond staying safe) is and should remain an <em>ura</em> domain, one not spoken of, but revealed solely through experience.</p><p>Perhaps all I could say of it is: lean in, give it your attention, open your eyes, your hands, your heart.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><ol class="smaller">

    <li>'When applied to Japan geographically, the east side is the <em>omote</em> because it is the face of Japan that everyone knows about, particularly in the case of foreigners.

    <li>'The implications for Japanese psychological functioning of the inter-relationships of two concepts familiar to Japanese are discussed: omote, literally “face” is the pattern one would show to others; ura, “mind” in old Japanese, those private and intimate thoughts which generally are not to be shown to others', <em>Doi L Takeo</em> in <a href="https://journals.lww.com/jonmd/Abstract/1973/10000/Omote_and_Ura__Concepts_Derived_From_the_Japanese.5.aspx"></a></li>
