                    <p>So, this really was our last class of the year, sandwiched between Christmas and New Year. The weather at start of evening: -8º; by the end: -12º.</p><p>After a thorough warm-up, we did a rather ad-hoc <em>ikkyo</em> from kneeling - discovering just how little effort it takes to move someone towering over us, if we stay relaxed and give them no extra information (i.e. minimal movement).</p><p>Then 1st form <em>ikkyo</em> kneeling, with a very dynamic <em>uke</em>, prompting lots of knee-walking to stretch the <em>uke</em> beyond their balance.</p><p>After that (knees demanding relief), Christmas cake or gingerbread trees with tea in the break. Oh yes.</p><p>The second half looked at 9th form <em>tenchinage</em>, and we got ourselves stuck with over-enthusiastic <em>uke</em>s - what happens when they are ahead of the movement? (Often this comes across as overly pushy or forceful, not listening to the <em>nage</em>'s cues).</p><p>Discovery time!</p><p>When the <em>uke</em> grabs me "too hard", I instantly separate from them in my mind ("They're too aggressive, too overbearing, I'll never be able to shift them"). </p><p>It seems that one solution lies in what I wish for them ("I wish they were softer"), except that's not up to them. If I can become <em>softer</em>, it complements their <em>hardness</em> and movement starts again.</p><p>As work and the season allows, I like to ski and climb when possible. When the ski slope is too steep, I don't berate it, I adjust myself – attending to my posture, balance and speed. When the route on the bouldering wall is too hard, I don't blame it, I adjust myself – relaxing more, easing through my reaches.</p><p>However, when the challenge comes from another person rather than an inanimate object, I frequently catch myself blaming them ("she should be softer; he shouldn't be so tall") – distancing and isolating myself from them – rather than considering what I might change in myself, and what that change might bring to the relationship.</p><p>So, when held hard by someone tall and immovable this evening, my tendency was to freeze and blame them for being too much. When I thought about how I would like my partner to be (<em>easier, less overwhelming</em>), it gave the cue for what I could offer them.</p><p>When my partner felt hard and tight around my wrists, I would work on feeling soft and loose in myself, and then allow that quality to be available to my partner. When my partner deliberately resisted me, I wanted them to accept my movement, so I started by accepting their resistance. When I experienced them as pushing too hard, I tried allowing where they wanted to go. When they held limply, with no direction, I offered confidence and direction in my body.</p><p>In all these cases, as soon as I could find the complementary quality in myself, the problem melted away, and the exercise flowed to its conclusion.</p><p>I think there are two really important lessons here: </p><ol><li>we cannot expect our partners to change, we cannot force them into changing. Instead, all that is within our power is to change ourselves, but if that is done with an open heart, it is likely to encourage change in them too. </li><li>When we get stuck, and wish that they were different somehow, perhaps that is what we can start to offer them. <em>You should be more relaxed</em> becomes me relaxing, becomes the situation easing, becomes movement. <em>You should be more patient with me</em> might become <em>I am more patient with you and me</em>.</li></ol><p>As an aside, as I was investigating qualities, there was clearly a difference between what my <em>uke</em> was doing (<em>I'm being strong</em>) and what I physically experienced of them (<em>he is unmoving and tight</em>). When I initially tried to find the complementary quality to <em>strong</em>, I got <em>weak</em> and that was a very strange and uncomfortable feeling. However, when I worked with the actual sensations of <em>unmoving and tight</em>, finding useful opposites was much easier, and much more productive. So if you're ever tempted to try this, I'd suggest finding a positive quality, rather than one that's seen as negative.</p><p>We can work on rehabilitating weakness another day 😉</p><p>#2018isaroundthecorner #cakeforeveryteabreak</p><p>We are a great little club, and we would love more members to join us. We meet every Thursday evening in Roy Bridge; we welcome all ages, stages, and levels of mobility. If you pop in to say hello, we will share our cake with you, because we're polite like that.</p>
