                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>I spent a few days studying with <a href="http://wheelersystema.com/about-martin-wheeler/">Martin Wheeler</a> of <a href="http://www.russianmartialart.com/">Systema</a> fame, something I would recommend to anyone. During that time, I had a few fascinating moments attacking him. Or, rather, attempting to. Perhaps the most interesting experience was when he seemed to disappear repeatedly as I attacked him.</p><p>He would pop up in front of me, and then as my attention latched on to him and I moved, he disappeared. I would invariably find him behind me. It was astonishing. I have been trying to make head or tail of it ever since.</p><p>I think we are aware of others in two ways at once: through our vision and through our felt-sense. The latter relies on moments of meeting the other person, bumping into their tension, feeling the pull or push of their direction, and so on.</p><p>However, when their tension doesn't exist, there's very little for our body to pick up on, even though we can see them. Our two systems collide, as they offer conflicting information to the brain. He's there – I can see him. No, he's not – because I can't feel him.</p><p>In our class, we study <em>ki development</em> first, and then <em>aikido</em>. Usually, the ki development exercise is something that can be studied or applied further in the aikido practice. Take, for example, the exercise known as <em>unbendable arm</em>.</p><p>When we study this as a <em>ki</em> exercise, we push gently upwards from below the wrist, and downwards through the elbow to see if the arm will bend. When the partner is incorrect, the arm bends. When the partner is correct, the arm bends enough to take up the slack, and then it stops despite increasing pressure. From the point of view of the tester, there is movement, and then there is none, and at that point, the tester feels the increasing compression of trying to move something that is immovable.</p><p>As we move into this as part of an aikido exercise, however, we don't want to give the tester (now the <em>uke</em>) the information that we are immovable. We don't want them to experience the increasing compression of pushing an unyielding arm. Therefore, we move. This is our choice, it is the result of an immovable mind. And it hides us from the <em>uke</em>. We are not moving because the pressure of the push forces us; we are moving to remain invisible. We aim to be as responsive to our partner's touch as possible, so that they cannot gain a sense of where we are, of how light or heavy we are, of how pliant or stiff we are.</p><p>Therefore, during aikido, if our partner experiences the immovable nature of our unbendable arm, we have given ourselves away. Instead, they should feel the arm move in concert with them – to the extent that they couldn't say whether they are moving the arm or whether they are following the arm's movement. In other words, the action has become person-less.</p><p>I still don't know what Martin Wheeler did to achieve his invisibility, but this is my best guess. Complete relaxation, complete responsiveness, complete calmness. Whether I've got that right or not is moot, it's still a worthwhile path to explore.</p><p></p>
