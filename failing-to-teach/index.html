                    <p>For a while, the club had a strong-wristed student who had previously studied <em>karate</em>. His posture and movement announced very clearly his deeply-grounded stability.</p><p>One of the last times he attended, we studied 1st form <em>nikkyo</em>, and came unstuck. From previous experience, it's moments like these that offer most learning, so here's my post mortem.</p><p>The challenge with studying aikido is to remember that we are not learning techniques in the way we might follow a map (turn left here, next go straight and then turn right); rather, we are creating a context within which we can study how to be and how to move with a particular feeling.</p><p>Once we see the <em>nikkyo</em> as an exercise within which certain principles are embedded, just waiting to be revealed, we can allow ourselves to become more sensitive to what's going on. </p><p>As a teacher, I have something in mind when I call a student's attention to a particular detail. <em>Here, look at this, isn't it interesting? How might it change things?</em> But if we think that a martial art is solely about fighting or self-defence, we may have the view that I should impose my superior technical skill upon him until he has to submit.</p><p>This difference of perspective is precisely why I refer to the complementary roles of <em>nage</em> (thrower) and <em>uke</em> (receiver of the throw) as <em>partners</em>, not opponents or attackers or enemies. When we enter a context as opponents, victory is gained by one vanquishing the other; when we work as partners, victory is victory for both (though how that looks precisely depends upon one's role).</p><p>Then, add to that, the complementary roles of teacher and student, and we have a complex relationship going on. Are we attending this exercise as opponents or partners? Are we studying together, or am I teaching you? As teacher, it's my job to work with you in order to draw you to a greater level of skill. As a partner, it's my job to work with myself to develop greater resilience through sensitivity. As an opponent, it's my job to thwart you.</p><p>As a teacher, all too often, I want to investigate a particular detail and set the exercise up so that we can both study it comfortably. If I wanted to study that detail in a realistic context, that detail probably wouldn't emerge. In the case of <em>nikkyo</em>, I wanted to look at how we twist around our partner's wrist rather than press on it, but for real he should already have lost his balance so that there is no opportunity to press on the wrist as it is already falling away.</p><p>To study the detail, I allowed him to stand up balanced but then his structure allowed him to resist. "This doesn't work on me," was his response.</p><p>As I write this, it seems simple and straightforward to resolve in the moment, but then it wasn't and I couldn't quite get my head around it. Days later I realised another complication:– I wasn't showing him how I do <em>nikkyo</em> on him, I was showing him how to do <em>nikkyo</em> on someone else, specifically a beginner.</p><p>Our 1st form <em>nikkyo</em> has at least 5 different possibilities in a single set of movements. To be clear, I don't mean different movement variations; I mean different mind movements within the physical movement. Yeah, that doesn't help much, does it.</p><ol><li>once the <em>nikkyo</em> wrist relationship is in place, you can extend your mind down through your fingers draping over the wrist</li><li>down the front of your partner</li><li>down through your partner's head</li><li>projecting through their little finger back to their head</li><li>projecting your fingers down and in to your own One Point</li></ol><p>Each way expresses more power as a result of the mind's projection, and is experienced as more powerful by the <em>uke</em>.</p><p>So why, when working with a strong-wristed, stable <em>karateka</em> was I sticking with the first way. It wasn't enough to persuade him down, so why didn't I escalate until he succumbed?</p><p>Because I'm teaching him the ladder so that he can use it with others. If I only teach him what works on him, he will not have all the options available when dealing with others. If his next <em>uke</em> is a weak-wristed beginner, and he only has the nuclear option, he will hurt or damage them and they won't come back for more.</p><p>This isn't simply a case of being nice to others. It's also about helping them to develop stronger wrists – give them a <em>nikkyo</em> they can handle, and they will stay with it long enough to stretch their wrists. Give them a sharp <em>nikkyo</em>, and they will slam down without benefit to their own suppleness or strength.</p><p>When we <em>uke</em> for someone, we are not simply offering ourselves up as cannon-fodder, patiently being thrown around until it's our turn to do the fun stuff! In fact, <em>ukemi</em> is frequently thought of as the place where the real learning and transformation occurs. <em>Ukemi is the process by which the uke is opened and unlocked</em> (I want to put this in quotation marks, but can't find the citation).</p><p>We walk into a dojo stiff with preconceived ideas, stiff with nerves, stiff with movement habits. Aikido (undoubtedly all the martial arts) is a transformative practice – you do not leave as the same person plus a few techniques, you have changed, you have been unlocked physically (greater suppleness and sensitivity), mentally (greater resilience and intent), and emotionally (greater freedom from emotional constraints).</p><p>That is the process of <em>ukemi</em>, and therefore how we do <em>nikkyo</em> matters deeply. It is not a technique that looks uniformly one way; it is a mode of relationship to another person who is putting pressure on you. It is not a device to conquer an opponent; it is a study of subtlety.</p>
