                    <p>Among other things, I study Aikido. </p><p>It's been the longest journey I've made – of all my explorations – and it continues to unfold in ways I can't anticipate. Some of that journey is uphill, as in <em>looking up towards the mountain top;</em> most of it is definitely uphill, as in <em>challenging</em>.</p><p>Aikido is a Japanese <em>gendai</em> – a modern martial art. Although its existence was only made public in 1942, its lineage traces back through several <em>koryu</em> – martial arts from the Samurai era.</p><h3 id="theartofpeace">The Art of Peace?</h3>
<p>It is often spoken of in English as <em>The Art of Peace</em>. The <em>peace</em> comes from the Japanese word for <em>harmony</em>, and in a partnered art could be interpreted as harmony between the partners, hence <em>peace.</em></p><p>My current view is that this is slightly misleading and incomplete. The <em>harmony</em> starts with oneself – another word could be <em>balance</em>, as in the cyclical balance of <em>yin-yang</em>. That has implications for the body, the mind, and the spirit of the individual long before the relationship with the partner can be considered.</p><p>A brief glance at the sayings of the art's founder, <em>Morihei Ueshiba</em> (frequently referred to as <em>O Sensei</em>) reveal that he was a deeply spiritual man, studying a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oomoto">neo-Shinto religion</a>. This has led to complications over the years – many of his direct students have admitted that they did not understand what he was saying – as it wasn't clear whether he was teaching literally or metaphorically at any moment.</p><p>For some modern students that has become a problem – they come down on one side or another: fighting art or spiritual development – and struggle with the other perspective.</p><p>My aim is to hold on to all possibilities as long as I can, and that it's down to practice to resolve any conflict or tension created therein. Studying aikido because the words sound good, or flatter our desire to be nicer people, leaves us doing "thinking aikido". The words – all words – are attempts to communicate direct experience that exists at a deeper level. If we are to study aikido, we need to drive the words back down into the body of experience, like rubbing wax deep into the grain of a wood. Only the body can witness the truth or otherwise of the words, no matter how tempting they are to our minds.</p><h3 id="takemusuaiki"><em>Takemusu Aiki</em></h3>
<p>One thing that I do take at face value is <em>O Sensei's</em> later-years description of <em>takemusu aiki</em>: ultimate aikido is the spontaneous expression of its principles, rather than a curriculum of specific techniques.</p><p>However, I study that spontaneous aikido through a specific curriculum, without any sense of contradiction. We study a curriculum in order to develop ourselves; we gain proficiency in specific exercises to increase our mastery of the fundamentals required for spontaneous expression of the ultimate mystery of the art (be that metaphorical or literal).</p><p>My teacher, Sensei Williams of the Ki Federation of Great Britain, once said that if you can identify a movement, then it's not real, it's just training. Only when the movement occurs spontaneously, almost taking both nage and uke by surprise, is it real aikido.</p><h3 id="martial-art-means-fighting">Martial art means fighting</h3><p>No, it doesn't. Full stop.</p><p>Well, then, what's the point? I believe the aim of practice is to clean the slate – physical, mental, emotional – of crud so that we can face the world <em>opened and unlocked</em>.</p><p>Physically, that means supple, responsive, alert and aware, relaxed, tall. To bring these qualities deeply into the physical body requires a stripping away of all those physical habits that we have accumulated over time. Habits, both of movement and stiffness. </p><p>Mentally, that means open, aware, accepting, present, expansive, precise and decisive. To make these qualities innate requires us to drop all the mental habits that our monkey minds juggle about. Habits of thought are also habits of movement and stiffness.</p><p>Emotionally, that means open to difficult emotions existing within us without necessarily shaping or constraining us, open to fear, desire and loathing, impatience. To learn to allow such feelings without being controlled by them requires us to walk knowing into challenging moments, such as when several partners are about to attack us. Emotional habits also show our emotional stiffnesses – when we button up – and movements – when we fall into despair.</p><p>Altogether, cleaning the slate develops an autonomous, responsive, resilient individual, who can face pressure with a calm mind and open countenance. That is the very definition of a warrior. </p><p>The ability to fight at that point seems superfluous. Of course, in order to study properly we need to feel the keen edge of the attack so, as a by-product, we may well learn to defend ourselves. However, by the time we do, I'd suggest we no longer need to.</p>
