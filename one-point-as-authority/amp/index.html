                <p>Any martial art has associated etiquette. We may think that we follow it because it's an essential part of the tradition, but we are not Japanese, nor are we studying a particularly Japanese form of aikido. In fact, our organisation has minimised the amount of etiquette, yet what we have, we hold preciously.</p><p>One obvious example of this is that partners working together should not offer feedback on each other. That is akin to teaching, and "there is only one teacher on the mat".</p><p>So, here's my question: how do we learn to improve without feedback on what we have just done? Why does etiquette seem to discourage such communication?</p><p>In the first instance, I think it's useful to take a view on what role etiquette really performs – it's surely not just anachronistic other-culture imitation, is it? A bunch of rules from another place and another time followed either to catch us out or to make us feel more like the warriors we imagine ye olde samurai to have been?</p><p><em>The purpose of aikido is to develop our ability to be free under constraint</em>, to move and think freely (and therefore truly independently) under pressure. It's very clear how that pressure manifests in the physical realm: our partner holds us, and we seek to move fluidly with minimal effort.</p><p>However, the physical context is just one part of the process; the other is freedom of the mind. Arguably, this freedom of mind – to think and feel without getting caught up by those thoughts and emotions – is primary. Without a clear mind we cannot have a free body. If our mind is working in opposition or reaction to incoming pressures, our body will also be oppositional. We use the phrase <em>fighting mind</em> to denote such oppositional patterns of thought and behaviour.</p><p>I believe that etiquette performs a similar role for the mind that our partner's grasp does for the body. Etiquette constrains us whilst inviting us to find real, meaningful freedom within such constraints. Over time, as we develop our freedom under pressure, so we gain real freedom with or without pressure – freedom of movement (a natural body) and freedom of mind (a creative, non-reactive, wise mind).</p><p>Back to the injunction that partners should not give each other feedback.</p><p>Well, what happens when we do? My partner throws me skilfully, and I say that they did well. I have validated their effort, and in so doing I have made myself the authority in that relationship. If they struggle and I kindly offer advice, I have affirmed that the mistake is theirs and I have made myself the authority in that relationship. </p><p>And what about my development? If I am watching and commenting upon their movements, there is likely little room for me to attend to my own development. We are equals in the relationship of an exercise, and we both have a vital role to play. If we are both watching the work of the <em>nage</em>, the thrower, then who is ensuring the development of the <em>uke</em>, the thrown? If I am <em>uke</em>, my focus needs to be on my role. Of course I will have opinions about my partner's performance, but since I am providing the all-important constraints, I should really attend to that task alone.</p><p>So much for the etiquette, what about the feedback? If my partner offers no response, where can I find an authoritative view of my movement?</p><h3 id="enter-the-one-point">Enter the One Point</h3><p>If there is no-one around us who can speak to our experience, we might look within ourselves for that feedback. The One Point is both viscera that moves and is moved, and also Center (physically, of gravity; somatically, of our being) that intuits and communicates.</p><h3 id="a-story">A story</h3><p>I have heard that my teacher's teacher, Abbe Kenshiro Sensei, would grunt whenever asked a question. I imagine that, at first, people thought he was working out how to reply in what was to him a foreign language, but eventually he was asked why he grunted.</p><p><em>I make that sound in order to send the question to my One Point, to ensure that my reply comes from the whole of me.</em></p><p>That might sound strange, but we had a young baby-sitter for a while who I would ask <em>how are you?</em> and she would reply <em>fine, thanks, how are you?</em> so quickly that it felt like bullets spitting from a machine gun. Over time, as she grew more comfortable with us, she would take longer to begin her reply, and tell us far more than <em>fine, thanks</em>.</p><h3 id="another-story">Another story</h3><p>I attended a series of conferences, each of which ended with a circle in which everyone would speak when they were ready in order to complete their attendance. I noticed that I tended to be one of the last to speak, and decided to sneak my words in earlier.</p><p>However, each time someone spoke, I listened and then sat momentarily to let their words settle in me. By the time I was ready to speak, someone else had already started talking. I noticed two things: the first was that the person who was determined to speak next wouldn't be listening to the speaker before them – they were already sounding the words in their head – and, secondly, what they had to say had no connection to what had been said before – it existed independently of everyone else.</p><p>When I spoke, finally, I often had no idea what I was going to say, and started with <em>I'm not sure what to say but ...</em> and then the words would come out fluently, taking me by surprise. I also received feedback that what I said summed the event up for everyone, not just for myself.</p><p>I believe that I was speaking from my One Point. By letting others' words percolate down into my Center, I mixed them with mine, and what came back out combined the different threads more effectively.</p><p>The response of the other participants was that I spoke with authority. Which is hard to square with the sense that I didn't know what I was going to say, until I allow the possibility of my One Point being the authority, rather than my verbal, thinking mind.</p><p>By allowing experiences all the way into the One Point, they pass through the head (thinking), the heart (feeling), and to the gut (intuition), and so those different but complementary elements are combined in my response. What better authority could we have to assess any experience?</p><p>And so, back to aikido etiquette. Perhaps we are not being left all alone to figure stuff out, so much as being invited to find that place within ourselves that can combine all the different aspects of our experience and create a deeper response to them. Perhaps, instead of asking for feedback from those that provide the constraints, we can learn to listen to the authority that is within us.</p>
